/*
 * Everything recurring runs from a single netcup scheduled task. The contract
 * only allows an HOURLY invocation, and netcup gives no guarantee about which
 * minute of the hour it lands on:
 *
 *     <unknown minute> * * * *  cd ~/httpdocs && php artisan schedule:run
 *
 * schedule:run fires a task only when the current minute matches its cron
 * expression. Anything narrower than `* * * * *` - hourly(), daily(),
 * dailyAt(), even everyTenMinutes() - can therefore miss that single tick
 * forever: dailyAt('03:30') never ran once, because the cron does not happen
 * to fall on minute 30 of hour 3.
 *
 * So every task below uses everyMinute() and is written to be idempotent. The
 * real cadence comes from the cron, not from the expression. A test in
 * tests/Feature/ScheduleTest.php keeps it that way.
 *
 * Shared hosting has no daemons, so there is no queue worker running in the
 * background - the scheduler drains the queue on each tick instead.
